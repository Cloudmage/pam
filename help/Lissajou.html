<h1>Introduction</h1><p><img alt="lissajou_main" src="images/2819_main.JPG" height="240" width="399" border="0" /></p><p>The Lissajou plugin shows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve">Lissajous curve</a>  on the left hand side and a pair of audio meters on the right. </p><p>The curve is generated by plotting the amplitude of each sample of the left channel on one axis against the ampltidude of the correspondong right channel sample.</p><h1>Options</h1><h2>Routing</h2><p><img alt="routing" src="images/2819_routing.JPG" height="240" width="401" border="0" /></p><p>The Routing option page allows the user to decide what channels are plotted on each axis.&nbsp;</p><p>First the user needs to decide on the routing mode:</p><ul><li>Follow - the channels plotted follow those routed to the audio output. In stereo mode Left will be on the X-axis and Right on the Y-axis.</li><li>Force - the user can decide what the X-axis and Y-axis are and these channels will also be routed to the audio output.</li><li>Indy - the user can decide what the X-axis and Y-axs are independant of the audio monitoring.</li></ul><p>The available channels are listeed below the X-axis and Y-axis labels. In Follow mode they be disabled. Note it is possible to choose the same channel for both axis.</p><h2>Display</h2><p><img alt="display" src="images/2819_display.JPG" height="240" width="402" border="0" /></p><p>The display mode allows the user to change how the Lissajou curve is displayed.</p><ul><li>dB - before plotting the amplitude of the sample is converted to dBs</li><li>Linear - no conversion takes place before the amplitude of the sample is plotted</li><li>Auto Scale - the peak level of each chunk of audio is taken and each sample is compressed/expanded so that low level signals are as easy to see as high level signals.</li></ul><p>The label at the top right of the Lissajou meter shows the current display mode and also the amount of expansion of the audio in Auto scale mode.</p><p>The LvR/MvS Axis switch decides what the X-Y axis represent:</p><ul><li>LvR - X-axis is Left and Y-axis is Right.</li><li>MvS - the axis are rotated by 45 degrees so that X-axis represents Middle (L+R) and Y-axis Side (L-R). This is the standard view for a Lissajou meter.</li></ul><p>The Hide/Show Levels switch either hides or displays a PPM scale. PPM 4 is shown in blue.</p><h2>Meters</h2><p><img alt="meters" src="images/2819_meters.JPG" height="240" width="399" border="0" /></p><p>The meters option page allows the user to choose between the 4 basic meter types for the audio meters on the right hand side of the screen.</p><p><u>PPM</u></p><p>Shows a&nbsp; digital Peak Program Meter. The ballistics 
and algorithm are taken from BBC R&amp;D baptools code. The scale is 
from 0-7<br /></p><p><u>Sample Peak</u></p><p>Shows the highest sample value for each chunk of incoming audio. <br /></p><p><u>Energy</u></p><p>Shows the Root Meam Square energy of each chunk of incoming audio</p><p><u>LKFS</u></p><p>Shows the Loudness of incoming audio integrated over 16 seconds. This is taken from the BBC R&amp;D baptools code.</p>
