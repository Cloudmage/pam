<h1>Introduction</h1><p><img alt="main" src="images/2822_main.JPG" height="240" width="400" border="0" /></p><p>The Radar plugin shows the level/loudness of one channel of audio as the distance from the center of a circle. As time advances the radar sweeps around the circle giving a history of audio level.</p><p>The label at the top left shows the instantaneous level of the audio.</p><p>The labels at the bottom left show the time it will take the radar to sweep round the circle and the refresh rate. Also the amount of time the radar has been running is shown.</p><p>The labels to the right show the meter mode and channel routing. </p><p>Note&nbsp; - the radar will be paused if the page is not selected. <br /></p><h1>Options</h1><h2>Routing</h2><p><img alt="routing" src="images/2822_main.JPG" height="240" width="400" border="0" /></p><p>The Routing 
options page allows you to select which channel you wish to show on the radar.<br /></p><p>In stereo mode the user is also allowed to select</p><ul><li>Middle (L+R)</li><li>Side (L-R)</li></ul><h2>Time</h2><p><img alt="time" src="images/2822_time.JPG" height="240" width="402" border="0" /></p><p>The time option page allows the user to set the Timespan and Refresh Rate of the sweep.</p><p><u>Timespan</u></p><p>This is the time it will take the radar to sweep around the circle.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Refresh Rate</u></p><p>This is the speed that the radar will be updated. e.g. a Refresh Rate of 50ms means the radar will be updated 20 times a second.</p><p>These two values combine to decide the angle that the sweep moves on each update. Long timespans will short refresh rates will result in small angle changes which may not all be noticeable.</p><h2>Meter</h2><p><img alt="meter" src="images/2822_meter.JPG" height="240" width="400" border="0" /></p><p>There are four possible meter modes that the Radar can operate in. The inner circles on the meter will change depending on the mode selected.&nbsp;</p><p><u>PPM</u></p><p>Shows a&nbsp; digital Peak Program Meter. The ballistics 
and algorithm are taken from BBC R&amp;D baptools code. The circles show PPM values. PPM 4 is shown as a pink cirle<br /></p><p><u>Sample Peak</u></p><p>Shows the highest sample value for each chunk of incoming audio. The circles are in -10dbFS steps with the outermost circle being 0dBFS<br /></p><p><u>Energy</u></p><p>Shows the Root Meam Square energy of each chunk of incoming audio. The circles are in -10dbFS steps with the outermost circle being 0dBFS <br /></p><p><u>LKFS</u></p><p>Shows the Loudness of incoming audio integrated over 8-16 seconds. The circles are in -10LKFS steps with the outermost circle being 0LKFS</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
